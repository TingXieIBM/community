# Zowe Doc Squad - 22PI4 - (2022/10/25 - 2023/01/23)

## Add and improve the documentation

Goal: Onboard users efficiently with complete and easy to use content

Work items: 

- Review and refactor the documentation to clarify usuage content and extend content
  - Check and organize the content per category. For example, move the current "Installing server component" topic from Extend to Use.
  - Clarify confusing concept "Zowe component". For example, "Installing Zowe z/OS core components" and "Installing extended z/OS components"
  - Refactor the server-side components installation doc. For example, move "Installing Zowe containers" to "Installing Zowe z/OS components", add introduction topic about the different installation methods to clarify confusion.
- Components related
  - [Stretch] Zowe CLI: Complete part 2 of the installation checklist for V2 - an article named "Day One Checklist". This list will include a list of tasks that users can/should complete after Zowe CLI is installed and deployed.Â
