# Vulnerabilities

This document collect information related to the vulnerabilities. How Zowe processes the vulnerabilities and
notifies the general public about the found ones including the ones that were found within the dependencies
of Zowe. 

## Reporting

Zowe established security workgroup that regularly meets every week to discuss reported vulnerabilities. The
reports are coming from automated tools as well as from security reserachers and other third parties.

## Processing

The reports are discussed within the security workgroup and fixed based on the severity:

-  **Critical:** fixed as early as possible
-  **High:** fixed within next minor/patch release
-  **Medium and Low:** fixed when the squad decides to fix


## Disclosure

Zowe discloses the vulnerabilities in a timely manner but giving the user time to upgrade. The fixed vulnerabilities
will be available on the [zowe security page](https://www.zowe.org/security.html). Zowe won't disclose the 
vulnerabilities fixed in the latest release as we respect the need for at least 45 days to decide when and how will 
the users upgrade Zowe. 

When the new release of Zowe is public we will publish the vulnerabilities fixed in the previous release. For example 
when we release Zowe 2.3 we will publish the list of vulnerabilities that were fixed between 2.1 and 2.2 versions of Zowe
