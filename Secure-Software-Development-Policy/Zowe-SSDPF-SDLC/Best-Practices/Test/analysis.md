#Analysis

The following list is based on the [Core Infrastructure Initiative](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/criteria/0) 

## Static code analysis

* The squad uses at least one of the static code analysis tools accepted by Zowe for the release of their component. 
* The medium and higher severity exploitable vulnerabilities discovered with static code analysis MUST be fixed in a timely way after they are confirmed.
* It is SUGGESTED that static source code analysis occur on every commit or at least daily.
