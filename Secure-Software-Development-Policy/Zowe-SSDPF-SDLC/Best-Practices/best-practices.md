# Zowe Secure Software Development Best Practices

This document contains links to Zowe Secure SDLC Best practices organized in sub-folders according to the secure software development lifecycle phases.
Best practices in general document the currently best known way to perform certain tasks. As such they can change over time as underlying technology or infrastructure changes.
Best Practices are mostly recommended, but in some cases could be required to be followed by the contributors in order to 
deliver their respective Zowe squad components with expected level of security as defined by the Zowe [Secure Software Development Policy]{link-to-ZoweSSDP-SDLC}.
