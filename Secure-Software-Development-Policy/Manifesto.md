# Zowe Secure Software Development Manifesto

- We strive to develop the most secure modern tools and interfaces for access to mainframe resources and services.

- Zowe will never compromise on mainframe security standards and in some cases would provide additional measures above that level, while opening the mainframe for integrations with the distributed world.

- Ze strive to never introduce a feature or change that circumvents or allows circumvention of z/OS security infrastructure.

- We commit to secure development best practices.

- We'll always follow/comply/adhere to/obey with/conform to cyber-security regulations.

```From NIST: SSFD ```
- Produce Well-Secured Software with minimal security vulnerabilities in its releases.
