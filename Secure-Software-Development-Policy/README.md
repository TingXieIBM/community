# Zowe Secure Software Development Policy Framework

This document describes the policy definition framework used to abstract the definition of the Zowe Secure Developemnt Policy.
The structure of the framework consists of:
- Manifesto

Provides a top level security vision and aims(#TODO@PZA: Link to Manifesto).

- A set of polices defining sets of requirements needed to fulfil the Manifesto vision    
  
A set of two policies is maintained to govern different aspects of the software development such as:
  - Zowe Secure Software Development - Organization Policy - abbreviated ZSSD-OP
  - Zowe Secure Software Development - Lifecycle Policy - abbreviated ZSSD-LP

- Processes definition 
Used to achieve the policy requirements fulfilment 
  As of the guidance intended to help contributors to fulfil the requirements Zowe provides [processes](Processes/processes.md) definitions.

- Best practices and guidelines for typical use cases, based on the best practices recommendations.
  Please see [best practices](./Best-Practices/best-practices.md) and [guidelines](./Guidelines/guidelines.md). Some guidelines are mandatory and in such cases this is explicitly declared in the corresponding documents. Some guidelines are optional. In such cases the tools and implementation technics described provide only a recommendation and the choice of instruments is
  left to the contributing organization/squad/team.

A reference to industry standards and regulatory requirements is provided where relevant.

A mapping between Zowe Secure Software Development policy items (requirements, best/recommended practices and guidelines)
and relevant standards, regulatory requirements or benchmarks is provided in separate documents to simplify policy governance and help customers
audit suitability and provability of Zowe security   

- Goals:
  - Keep it simple and extensible
  - Must be complete, i.e contributors could refer it and not need to define their own 
  - Clearly state where extension is possible 
  - Maintain reference to external requirements for approval of compliance and conformity
  - 

## Questions:
- Do all components must fulfill same security requirements? If not, how e decide (or who is in charge to decide) the level of security.
This is similar to the question as to what extent the contributors are responsible for defining their policy framework and 
- How to maintain transparency and evidence for our customers that regulatory and other requirements were actually met
  - badges, logs, issues, 
-
