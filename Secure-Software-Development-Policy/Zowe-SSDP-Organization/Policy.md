  - [Prepare the organization (PO)](#prepare-the-organization)
  - [Protect the Software (PS)](#protect-the-software)
  - [Produce Well-Secured Software (PW)](#produce-well-secured-software)
  - [Respond to Vulnerabilities (RV)](#respond-to-vulnerabilities)

### Submit an issue
[// intentionally commented out]: <> (You can submit an issue (Bug or Feature  on Zowe in general at https://github.com/zowe/community/issues/new/choose. If you have an issue that is specific to a squad or specific repository, feel free to submit an issue against a specific repo.)

### Pull Request Guidelines
[// intentionally commented out]: <> (Pull requests cannot be merged without the approval of at least one maintainer, who will be looking for the pull request to meet requirements as follows:)

[// intentionally commented out]: <> (* The pull request must state how to test this change, if applicable, such that the maintainer or a QA team can check correctness. The explanation may simply be to run included test code.)
[// intentionally commented out]: <> (* If a pull request depends upon a pull request from the same / another repository that is pending, this must be stated such that maintainers know in which order to merge open pull requests.)


## Respond to Vulnerabilities (RV)
### Identify and Confirm Vulnerabilities on an Ongoing Basis (RV.1):
### Assess, Prioritize, and Remediate Vulnerabilities (RV.2):
### Analyze Vulnerabilities to Identify Their Root Causes (RV.3): Help reduce the frequency of vulnerabilities in the future.
